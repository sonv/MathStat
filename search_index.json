The main goal is for you to explore on your own, with the equipped language learned from this class. The only rule is that each team can have at most TWO students. The project will have two components: Written report: students are expected to write a 5-10 page report about the chosen subject, written in LaTeX or similar mathematical writing tools such as LyX. Presentation: 20-minute presentations will be delivered by the end of the semester. Students are expected to write their own powerpoint/beamer slides to discuss what they learn. The expectation is that it should be understandable by anyone who has taken the class. Topics Students can pick the topics in the book of Wasserman from chapter 17 - chapter 24 or choose one of the liking (with the approval of the instructor) if they see interesting ideas outside of class.

A set \\(\\Sigma \\subseteq \\mathcal{P}(\\Omega)\\) of subsets of \\(\\Omega\\) is called a \\(\\sigma\\)-algebra of \\(\\Omega\\) if \\(\\Omega\\in \\Sigma\\) \\(F \\in \\Sigma \\implies F^C \\in \\Sigma\\) If \\(F_n \\in \\Sigma\\) for all \\(n\\in \\mathbb{N}\\), then \\[ \\bigcup_n F_n \\in \\Sigma .\\] It is extremely convenient to deal with things called open sets. The definition of those are a bit out of the scope of this class. However, in the case of the real line \\(\\mathbb{R}\\), open sets are defined to be made of by finite intersections and arbitrary unions of open intervals \\((a,b)\\). For example, \\((0,1)\\cup (2,3)\\) is an open set. Interestingly, \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) and \\(\\emptyset\\) are called clopen sets (here’s a funny YouTube video about clopen sets: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyD4p8_y8Kw) A Borel \\(\\sigma\\)-algebra is the smallest \\(\\sigma\\)-algebra that contains all the open sets. We denote the Borel \\(\\sigma\\)-algebra of a set \\(\\Omega\\) to be \\(\\mathcal{B}(\\Omega)\\). This is a rather abstract definition. There is no clear way to construct a sigma algebra from a collection of sets. However, the construction is not important as the reassurance that this object does exist to give us nice domains to work with when we define a probability measure (see below definition). Exercise 1.1 (Challenging– not required but good for the brain) It turns out that if \\(\\Omega\\) is a discrete set, it is typical to have the set of open sets contain every set of singletons, i.e., the set \\(\\{ a \\}\\) is open for every \\(a\\in \\Omega\\). Take this as an assumption, show that for any discrete set \\(\\Omega\\), \\(\\mathcal{B}(\\Omega) = \\mathcal{P}(\\Omega)\\). What open sets really are is not important for now. The important thing is that for \\(\\mathbb{R}^n\\) open sets are made of open intervals/ open boxes. Your typical intuitions still work. Philosophically, the \\(\\sigma\\)-algebra represents the details of information we could have access to. There are certain events that are building blocks of knowledge and that we don’t have access to finer details. Think about the \\(\\sigma\\)-algebra as a consistent model of what can be known (observed). For example, you can never know what’s going on in the houses on the street unless you have been to them. But somehow, together, you are still able to piece all the information you have about the houses to make sense of the world. This is related to the problem of information. How much information is enough to be useful in certain situation?! To have a consistent system is not the same as to know everything. The system you see/invent can never be exhaustively true, but you can still say something about the reality if you can have a system that is consistent with what you observe. This is why we do sampling!! When you have a consistent model, you now want to encode the model in such a way that it helps you with describing/predict the reality you see. A way to do that with no full knowledge of anything is to assign the certain number to measure the chance for something to happen at a given time. This encoding needs to happen on the model you constructed. This leads to the following definition of probability space. Definition 1.2 (Probability Space) A Probability Space is a triple \\((\\Omega, \\mathcal{F}, \\mathbb{P})\\), where \\(\\Omega\\) is a set called sample space, \\(\\mathcal{F}\\) is a \\(\\sigma\\)-algebra on \\(\\Omega\\), \\(\\mathbb{P}: \\mathcal{F}\\to [0,1]\\), called a Probability Measure, is a function that satisfies the following: \\(\\mathbb{P}(\\Omega) =1\\), If \\(F\\) is a disjoint union of \\(\\left\\{ F_n \\right\\}_{n=1}^\\infty\\), then \\[ \\mathbb{P}(F) = \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\mathbb{P}(F_n) . \\] Each element \\(\\omega \\in \\Omega\\) is called an outcome and each subset \\(A \\in \\mathcal{F}\\) is called an event. Definition 1.3 (Independent Events) Let \\(A, B \\in \\mathcal{F}\\) be events. We say that \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are independent if \\[ \\mathbb{P}(A \\cap B) = \\mathbb{P}(A) \\mathbb{P}(B) \\,. \\] Definition 1.4 (Conditional Probability) Let \\(A, B \\in \\mathcal{F}\\) be events such that \\(\\mathbb{P}(B) &gt;0\\). Then, the conditional probability of \\(A\\) given \\(B\\) is \\[ \\mathbb{P}(A \\vert B) = \\frac{\\mathbb{P}(A \\cap B)}{\\mathbb{P}(B)} \\,. \\] Theorem 1.1 (Bayes's Theorem) Let \\(A, B \\in \\mathcal{F}\\) be events such that \\(\\mathbb{P}(A)&gt;0\\) and \\(\\mathbb{P}(B) &gt;0\\). Then, \\[\\mathbb{P}(A | B) = \\frac{\\mathbb{P}(B | A) \\mathbb{P}(A)}{\\mathbb{P}(B)} \\,.\\] In modern statistics, there are names for the above terms: \\(\\mathbb{P}(A | B)\\) is called Posterior Probability, \\(\\mathbb{P}(B | A)\\) is called Likelihood, \\(\\mathbb{P}(A)\\) is called Prior Probability, \\(\\mathbb{P}(B)\\) is called Evidence. The theorem is often expressed in words as: \\[ \\text{Posterior Probability} = \\frac{\\text{Likelihood} \\times \\text{Prior Probability}}{\\text{Evidence}} \\] It is a good idea to ponder why those mathematical terms have those names. 1.1.2 Random Variables The notion of probability alone isn’t sufficient for us to describe ideas about the world. We need to have a notion of objects that associated with probabilities. This brings about the idea of random variable. Definition 1.5 (Random Variable) Let \\((\\Omega, \\mathcal{B}(\\Omega), \\mathbb{P})\\) be a probability space and \\((S, \\mathcal{B}(S))\\) a \\(\\sigma\\)-algebra. A random variable is a (Borel measurable) function from \\(\\Omega \\to S\\). \\(S\\) is called the state space of \\(X\\). In this course, we will restrict our attentions to two types of random variables: discrete and continuous. Definition 1.6 (Discrete RV) \\(X: \\Omega \\to S\\) is called a discrete RV if \\(S\\) is a countable set. A probability function or probability mass function for \\(X\\) is a function \\(f_X: S \\to [0,1]\\) defined by \\[ f_X(x) = \\mathbb{P}(X = x) \\,. \\] In contrast to the simplicity of discrete RV. Continuous RVs are a little bit messier to describe. This is because of the lack of background in measure theory so we can talk about this concept in a more precise way. Definition 1.7 (Continuous RV) A continuous random variable is a measurable function \\(X:\\Omega \\to S\\) is continuous if it satisfies the following conditions: \\(S = \\mathbb{R}^n\\) for some \\(n\\in \\mathbb{N}\\). There exists an (integrable) function \\(f_X\\) such that \\(f_X(x) \\geq 0\\) for all \\(x, \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^n} f_X(x) d x=1\\) and for every open cube \\(C \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}^n\\), \\[ \\mathbb{P}(X\\in C)=\\int_C f_X(x) dV . \\] The function \\(f_X\\) is called the probability density function (PDF). If two RVs \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) share the same probability function, we say that they have the same distribution and denote them by \\[ X \\stackrel{d}{=}Y.\\] In this case we also say that \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) are equal in distribution. Remark. To make the presentation more compact and clean, notationally, we will write \\[ \\int f(x) dx \\] to mean both integral (for continuous RV) and summation (for discrete RV). There are more general concepts of continuous RV where we don’t need to require \\(S\\) to be a Euclidean space as in the above definition. However, such concepts require the readers to be familiar with advanced subjects like Topology and Measure Theory. It is particularly important to know these two subjects in order to thoroughly understand Stochastic Processes. Exercise 1.2 Create a random variable that represents the results of \\(n\\) coin flips. For real-valued RV \\(X:\\Omega \\to \\mathbb{R}\\) we have the concept of cumulative distribution function. Definition 1.8 (Cumulative Distribution Function) Given a RV \\(X:\\Omega \\to \\mathbb{R}\\). The cumulative distribution function of \\(X\\) or CDF, is a function \\(F_X : \\mathbb{R}\\to [0,1]\\) defined by \\[ F_X (x) = \\mathbb{P}(X \\leq x) \\,. \\] Notationally, we use the notation \\(X\\sim F\\) to mean RV \\(X\\) with distribution \\(F\\). Exercise 1.3 Given a real-valued continuous RV \\(X: \\Omega \\to \\mathbb{R}\\), prove that if \\(f_X\\) is continuous then \\[ F_X(x)=\\int_{-\\infty}^x f_X(t) d t \\] is differentiable for every \\(x\\) and \\(f_X(x)=F_X^{\\prime}(x)\\). Exercise 1.4 Let \\(X\\) be an RV with CDF \\(F\\) and \\(Y\\) with CDF \\(G\\). Suppose \\(F(x) = G(x)\\) for all \\(x\\). Show that for every set \\(A\\) that is a countable union of open intervals, \\[ \\mathbb{P}(X \\in A) = \\mathbb{P}(Y \\in A) \\,.\\] Exercise 1.5 Let \\(X:\\Omega \\to \\mathbb{R}\\) be an RV and \\(F_X\\) be its CDF. Prove the following: \\(F\\) is non-decreasing: if \\(x_1 \\leq x_2\\), then \\(F(x_1) \\leq F(x_2)\\). \\(F\\) is normalized: \\[ \\lim_{x\\to -\\infty} F(x) = 0 \\,,\\] and \\[ \\lim_{x\\to \\infty} F(x) = 1 \\,.\\] \\(F\\) is right-continuous: \\[ F(x) = F(x+) = \\lim_{y \\searrow x} F(y) \\,.\\] 1.1.3 Joint distribution of RVs Let \\(X:\\Omega \\to S\\) and \\(Y: \\Omega \\to S\\) be RVs. We denote \\[ \\mathbb{P}(X \\in A; Y \\in B) = \\mathbb{P}(\\{X\\in A\\} \\cap \\{Y \\in B \\}) \\,. \\] For discrete RVs, the joint probability function of \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) has the following meaning \\[f_{XY}(x,y) = \\mathbb{P}(X = x; Y = y)\\] For continuous RVs, the situations are more complicated as we can’t make sense of \\(\\mathbb{P}(X = x; Y = y)\\) (this is always 0 in most situation and in some other situation, one can’t even talk about it– this is a topic of more advanced course in measure theory). However, we can have \\[\\mathbb{P}(X \\in A; Y \\in B) = \\int_{X \\in A} \\int_{Y \\in B} f_{XY} (x,y) \\, dx dy \\,.\\] Another way to look at the above is the following. We can even consider \\(X: \\Omega \\to S^n\\), where \\(n\\geq 2\\). Instead of thinking about this as one RV, we can think about this as a vector of RVs: \\[ X = \\begin{pmatrix} X_1 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ X_n \\end{pmatrix},\\] where \\(X_1, \\dots X_n: \\Omega \\to S\\) are RVs. Because of this, we have can write the density function as \\[ f_X(x) = f_{X_1 X_2 \\dots X_n}(x)\\] Some people call \\(X\\) a random vector. \\(f_{X_1\\dots X_n}\\) is called the joint probability distribution. Exercise 1.6 True or false: \\(f_{XY}(x,y) = f_{X}(x) + f_{Y}(y)\\) \\(f_{XY}(x,y) = f_{X}(x) f_{Y}(y)\\) Definition 1.9 (Marginal density) The marginal density of \\(X_i\\) is \\[f_{X_i}(x_i) = \\int f_{X_1\\dots X_n}(x_1, \\dots, x_n) \\, dx_1\\dots dx_{i-1} dx_{i+1} \\dots dx_n\\] (integrate coordinate except the \\(i\\)-th coordinate. Exercise 1.7 Can you construct \\(f_{XY}\\) if you know \\(f_X\\) and \\(f_Y\\)? 1.1.4 Some important random variables Point mass distribution (Dirac delta): Given a discrete probability \\(X: \\Omega \\to S\\). \\(X\\) has a point mass distribution at \\(a \\in S\\) if \\[ \\mathbb{P}( X = a) = 1.\\] We call \\(X\\) a point mass RV and write \\(X \\sim \\delta_a\\). Question. Suppose \\(S = \\mathbb{N}\\). Write down \\(F_X\\) for the point mass RV \\(X\\). Discrete uniform distribution: \\(f_X(k) = \\frac 1 n\\,,\\) \\(k \\in \\{1,\\dots, n\\}\\). Bernoulli distribution: let \\(X:\\Omega \\to \\{0,1\\}\\) be RV that represents a binary coin flip. Suppose \\(\\mathbb{P}(X = 1) = p\\) for some \\(p \\in [0,1]\\). Then \\(X\\) has a Bernoulli distribution, written as \\(X \\sim \\text{Bernoulli}(p)\\). The probability function is \\[f_X(x) = p^x (1-p)^{1-x}.\\] We write \\(X \\sim \\text{Bernoulli}(p)\\). Binomial distribution: let \\(X:\\Omega \\to \\mathbb{N}\\) be the RV that represents the number of heads out of \\(n\\) independent coin flips. Then \\[ f_X = \\begin{cases} {n \\choose x} p^x (1-p)^{n-x}\\,, x\\in \\{0,1,\\dots, n\\}\\\\ 0 \\,, \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases}\\] We write \\(X \\sim \\text{Binomial}(n,p)\\). Poisson distribution: \\(X \\sim \\text{Poisson}(\\lambda)\\). \\[f_X (k) = e^{-\\lambda} \\frac{\\lambda^k}{k!}\\,, k = 0, 1, 2 \\dots\\] \\(X\\) is a RV that describe a given number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space if these events occur with a known constant mean rate and independently of the time since the last event Gaussian: \\(X \\sim N(\\sigma,\\mu)\\). \\[f_X(x) = \\frac{1}{\\sigma\\sqrt{2\\pi}} e^{-(x-\\mu)^2/(2\\sigma^2)}.\\] Exercise 1.8 Let \\(X_{n,p} \\sim \\text{Binomial}(n,p)\\). Suppose that as \\(n\\to \\infty\\), \\(p \\to 0\\) in such a way that \\(np = \\lambda\\) always. Let \\(x\\in \\mathbb{N}\\). For \\(n\\) very very large, what is the behaviour of \\[ \\frac{n!}{(n-x)!} \\,.\\] (You should just get some power of \\(n\\)) Show that \\[\\lim_{n\\to \\infty} f_{X_{n,p}}(x) = \\frac{\\lambda^x e^{-\\lambda}}{x!}.\\] Interpret this result. 1.1.5 Independent random variables Definition 1.10 Let \\(X:\\Omega \\to S\\) and \\(Y: \\Omega \\to S\\) be RVs. We say that \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) are independent if, for every \\(A, B \\in \\mathcal{B}(S)\\), we have \\[ \\mathbb{P}( X \\in A; Y \\in B) = \\mathbb{P}(X \\in A) \\mathbb{P}(Y \\in B) \\,, \\] and write \\(X \\perp Y\\). So, if \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) are independent, \\[f_{XY}(x,y) = f_X(x) f_Y(y).\\] Definition 1.11 Let \\(X:\\Omega \\to S\\) and \\(Y: \\Omega \\to S\\) be RVs. Suppose that \\(f_Y(y) &gt;0\\). The conditional probability mass function of \\(X\\) given \\(Y\\) is \\[ f_{X|Y} (x|y) = \\frac{f_{XY}(x,y)}{f_Y(y)} \\,.\\] Exercise 1.9 Let \\[ f(x,y) = \\begin{cases} x+y \\,, 0\\leq x \\leq 1, 0 \\leq y \\leq 1\\\\ 0\\,, \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases}.\\] What is \\(\\mathbb{P}( X &lt; 1/4 \\vert Y = 1/3)\\). Note that the above exercise is a little bit weird and counter-intuitive. While \\(\\mathbb{P}( X &lt; 1/4 , Y = 1/3) = 0\\) (why?), \\(\\mathbb{P}( X &lt; 1/4 | Y = 1/3) \\not= 0\\) A very important RV is the multivariate Normal RV, which obeys the following density function \\[f(x; \\mu, \\Sigma) = \\frac{1}{(2\\pi)^{n/2} | \\Sigma |^{1/2}} \\exp\\big( -\\frac{1}{2} (x-mu)^T \\Sigma^{-1} (x-\\mu) \\big).\\] 1.1.6 Transformations of RVs Sometimes, we don’t work with RV directly but certain characteristics of RVs. Those characteristics are represented by certain transformation. If the functions are nice enough, we can actually have a recipe to generate the probability density function. Suppose \\(g: S^n \\to \\mathbb{R}\\) and \\(Z = g(X_1, \\dots, X_n)\\). Let \\(A_z = \\{ (x_1,\\dots, x_n): g(x_1,\\dots, x_n) \\leq z \\}\\). Then \\[F_Z(z) = \\mathbb{P}(Z \\leq z) = \\mathbb{P}(g(X_1, \\dots, X_n) \\leq z) = \\int_{A_z} f_{X_1\\dots X_n}(x_1,\\dots,x_n) \\, dx_1\\dots dx_n, \\] and \\[f_Z(z) = F_Z&#39;(z).\\] Exercise 1.10 Let \\(X, Y \\sim \\text{Uniform}(0,1)\\) be independent RVs, i.e., \\[f_{X}(x) = f_{Y}(y) = 1\\,.\\] What is the density function for the RV \\(Z = X + Y\\)? Same question but \\(X, Y \\sim N(0,1)\\). Definition 1.12 RVs that are independent and share the same distribution are called independent and identically distributed RVs. We often shorthand this by IID RVs. 1.1.7 Expectation Definition 1.13 Let \\(X\\) be a RV. The expected value, or expectation, or mean, or first moment of \\(X\\) is defined to be \\[ \\mathbb{E}X = \\int x f(x) dx. \\] The variance of \\(X\\) is defined to be \\[\\mathbb{E}\\left( X - \\mathbb{E}X \\right)^2\\] We often denote \\(\\mu_X\\) to be the expectation of \\(X\\), \\(\\sigma_X^2\\) (\\(\\mathrm{Var}(X), \\mathbb{V}(X)\\)) to be the variance of \\(X\\). The square root of the variance, \\(\\sigma\\), is called the standard deviation. Theorem 1.2 Let \\(X:\\Omega \\to S\\) be a RV, \\(r: S \\to S\\) be a function and \\(Y = r(X)\\). Then \\[ \\mathbb{E}Y = \\mathbb{E}(r(X)) = \\int r(x) f(x) dx \\] Exercise 1.11 Let \\(X \\sim \\text{Uniform}(0,1)\\). Compute \\(\\mathbb{E}Y\\), where \\(Y = e^X\\). \\(Y = \\max(X, 1-X)\\) Let \\(X,Y\\) be RVs that have jointly uniform distribution on the unit square. Compute \\(\\mathbb{E}(X^2 + Y^2)\\). Definition 1.14 Let \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) be RVs. The covariance between \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) is defined by \\[ \\mathrm{Cov}(X,Y) = \\mathbb{E}\\left( (X- \\mu_X)(Y - \\mu_Y) \\right) .\\] The correlation of \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) is defined to be \\[ \\rho_{X,Y} = \\frac{\\mathrm{Cov}(X,Y)}{\\sigma_X \\sigma_Y} \\,.\\] Theorem 1.3 Let \\(X_i\\), \\(i=1, \\dots, n\\) be RVs and \\(a_i\\)’s be constants. Then \\[ \\mathbb{E}\\left(\\sum_i a_i X_i \\right) = \\sum_i a_i \\mathbb{E}X_i. \\] \\[ \\mathbb{V}X_i = \\mathbb{E}(X_i^2) - \\mu_{X_i}^2 \\] \\[ \\mathbb{V}\\left( \\sum_i a_i X_i \\right) = \\sum_i a_i^2 \\mathbb{V}(X_i) \\] \\[ \\mathbb{V}\\left( \\sum_i a_i X_i \\right) = \\sum_i a_i^2 \\mathbb{V}(X_i) + 2\\sum_{i&lt;j} a_i a_j \\mathrm{Cov}(X_i, X_j) \\,. \\] Suppose further that \\(X_i\\)’s are independent, then \\[ \\mathbb{E}\\left( \\prod_{i=1}^n X_i \\right) = \\prod_{i=1}^n \\mathbb{E}X_i\\] and \\[ \\mathbb{V}\\left( \\sum_i a_i X_i \\right) = \\sum_i a_i^2 \\mathbb{V}(X_i) \\,. \\] Definition 1.15 (Conditional Expectation) Let \\(X,Y:\\Omega \\to S\\), where \\(S\\) is either \\(\\mathbb{N}\\) or \\(\\mathbb{R}\\). The conditional expectation of \\(X\\) given \\(Y\\) is a RV \\(\\mathbb{E}[X | Y] : \\Omega \\to \\mathbb{R}\\) that satisfies the following \\[ \\mathbb{E}[X | Y](y) := \\mathbb{E}[X | Y = y] = \\int x f_{X|Y}(x|y) \\, dx . \\] If \\(r:S^2 \\to S\\) is a function, then \\[ \\mathbb{E}[r(X,Y) | Y = y] = \\int r(x,y) f_{X|Y}(x|y) \\, dx .\\] One can generalize this definition to higher dimension via the coordinate-wise conditional expectation.

Recall that two RVs \\(X \\stackrel{d}{=}Y\\) means that \\(F_X (x) = F_Y(x)\\). Two common ways to characterize the equality in distribution are to use the generating functions and the characteristic functions. These ideas are not orginally from probability but from engineering/mechanics, where Laplace and Fourier transforms are understood very well since the 18th century. Exercise 1.14 In general, differentiation is not commutative with integration, that is \\[ \\frac{d}{dt} \\int \\not= \\int \\frac{d}{dt}. \\] However, assuming that this is true for certain moment generating functions \\(\\varphi_X\\). Show that \\[ \\varphi_X^{(n)}(0) = \\mathbb{E}( X^n),\\] where \\(f^{(n)}\\) denotes the \\(n\\)-th derivative of \\(f\\). \\(\\mathbb{E}(X^n)\\) is called the \\(n\\)-th moment of \\(X\\) and it tells you the tail behavior of \\(f_X\\). 1.2.1 Moment Generating Functions Theorem 1.5 Let \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) be RVs. If \\(\\varphi_X(t) = \\varphi_Y(t)\\) for all \\(t\\) in an interval around 0, then \\[ X \\stackrel{d}{=}Y \\,.\\] The full proof of this is beyond this class (and could be a great topic for a project). However, we will prove this for finte RVs. Proposition 1.1 (Finite RV case) Let \\(X,Y: \\Omega \\to \\{1,2, \\dots, N\\}\\) be RVs. If \\(\\varphi_X(t) = \\varphi_Y(t)\\) in an interval around in an interval \\((-\\epsilon , \\epsilon)\\), then \\[ X \\stackrel{d}{=}Y \\,.\\] Proof. We have that \\[ \\varphi_X (t) = \\mathbb{E}( e^{tX}) = \\sum_{i= 1}^N e^{it}\\mathbb{P}( X = i) \\] and \\[ \\varphi_Y (t) = \\mathbb{E}( e^{tX}) = \\sum_{i= 1}^N e^{it}\\mathbb{P}( Y = i). \\] Therefore, \\[ 0 = \\varphi_X(t) - \\varphi_Y(t) = \\sum_{i=1}^N (e^t)^i \\left( \\mathbb{P}(X = i) - \\mathbb{P}(Y = i) \\right) \\] for every \\(t \\in (-\\epsilon , \\epsilon)\\). Therefore, as the above is a polynomial, \\[ \\mathbb{P}( X = i) = \\mathbb{P}(Y = i) \\] where \\(i = 1, \\dots, N\\). Note that if the above summation is infinite, then we cannot conclude that \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) has the same distribution as easily as we just did. More work has to be done to show this. A note of caution: the assumption that \\(\\varphi_X = \\varphi_Y\\) in an interval around \\(0\\) is crucial in general. An interesting observation arises: for analytic functions we have the Taylor series \\[ f(x) = \\sum_{i=0}^\\infty \\frac{f^{(n)}(0)}{n!} x^n. \\] Exercise 1.14 tells you that the \\(n\\)-th derivative at \\(0\\) of a moment generating function would be the \\(n\\)-th moment of the RV. Question: Is knowing the moments of \\(X\\) enough to determine its probability distribution? The answer is NO. One can take a look at the discussion about this problem here: https://mathoverflow.net/questions/3525/when-are-probability-distributions-completely-determined-by-their-moments. However, things are nice for finite RVs. Proposition 1.2 Let \\(X,Y: \\Omega \\to \\{1,2, \\dots, N\\}\\) be RVs. Suppose that \\[ \\mathbb{E}(X^n) = \\mathbb{E}(Y^n) &lt; \\infty\\] for every \\(n\\in \\mathbb{N}\\). Then \\[ X \\stackrel{d}{=}Y .\\] Proof. Consider \\[ \\varphi_X(t) = \\mathbb{E}(e^{Xt}) = \\sum_{i = 1}^N e^{it} \\mathbb{P}( X = i). \\] This is a finite sums of analytic functions and is, therefore, analytic. Thus, \\(\\varphi_X\\) can be expanded into Taylor series, i.e., \\[ \\varphi_X(t) = \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty \\frac{\\varphi_X^{(n)}(0)}{n!} t^n = \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty \\frac{\\mathbb{E}(X^n)}{n!} t^n.\\] This means that the moments of \\(X\\) determines its moment generating function (which may not be true in general). A similar argument can be made for \\(\\varphi_Y\\) and as the coefficents of the Taylor series are the same (being the moments of \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\)), we conclude that \\[\\varphi_X = \\varphi_Y.\\] Therefore, by Theorem 1.5, \\[ X \\stackrel{d}{=}Y, \\] as desired. 1.2.2 Characteristic Functions Similar idea with the moment generating functions, but characteristic functions are easier to work with and we don’t have to work with special case of finite RVs. Theorem 1.6 Let \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) be RVs. If \\(\\phi_X(t) = \\phi_Y(t)\\) for all \\(t\\) in an interval around 0, then \\[ X \\stackrel{d}{=}Y \\,.\\] In order to prove this theorem, we need the following important result, called inversion formula of the characteristic functions. Theorem 1.7 (Inversion Formula) Let \\(X:\\Omega \\to S\\) be a RV (either continuous or discrete) and \\(\\phi_X\\) be its characteristic function. Then \\[ \\lim_{T \\to \\infty} \\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\int_{-T}^T \\frac{e^{-i\\theta a} - e^{-i\\theta b}}{i\\theta} \\phi_X(\\theta) \\, d\\theta = \\mathbb{P}( a &lt; X &lt; b) + \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\mathbb{P}(X = a) + \\mathbb{P}(X = b) \\right). \\] Proof. We have \\[\\begin{aligned} \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_{-T}^T \\frac{ e^{ - i \\theta a} - e^{- i \\theta b}}{i\\theta} \\phi_X(\\theta) \\, d\\theta &amp; = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_{-T}^T \\frac{ e^{ - i \\theta a} - e^{- i \\theta b}}{i\\theta} \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} e^{i\\theta x} f_X(x) \\, d\\theta dx \\\\ &amp; = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}}\\frac{1}{\\pi} \\int_{-T}^T \\frac{ e^{ i \\theta (x - a)} - e^{i \\theta (x- b)}}{ 2 i\\theta} f_X(x) \\, d\\theta dx \\\\ \\end{aligned}\\] Note that since \\(\\cos(t)/t\\) is odd and \\(\\sin(t)/t\\) is even, and that \\(e^{i\\theta} = \\cos(\\theta) + i \\sin(\\theta)\\), we have \\[ \\frac{1}{2}\\int_{-T}^T \\frac{e^{i\\theta c}}{i \\theta} = \\int_0^T \\frac{\\sin(\\theta c)}{\\theta} \\, d\\theta. \\] Therefore, \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_{-T}^T \\frac{ e^{ - i \\theta a} - e^{- i \\theta b}}{i\\theta} \\phi_X(\\theta) \\, d\\theta &amp;= \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} \\int_0^T \\left( \\frac{\\sin((x - a)\\theta)}{\\theta} - \\frac{\\sin((x - b)\\theta)}{\\theta} \\right) f_X(x) \\, d\\theta dx \\end{aligned} \\] Taking the limit \\(T\\to\\infty\\) and using the fact that \\[ \\lim_{T \\to \\infty}\\int_0^T \\frac{\\sin ((x-a)\\theta)}{\\theta} d\\theta = \\begin{cases} \\frac{-\\pi}{2} \\,, &amp; x &lt; a \\,,\\\\ \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\,, &amp; x &gt; a \\,, \\\\ 0 \\,, &amp; x = a \\,. \\end{cases}\\] Therefore, \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\lim_{T\\to \\infty}\\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_{\\mathbb{R}}\\int_{-T}^T \\frac{ e^{ - i \\theta a} - e^{- i \\theta b}}{i\\theta} \\phi_X(\\theta) \\, d\\theta dx &amp;= \\left(\\int_{(a,\\infty)} f_X(x) \\, dx - \\int_{ (-\\infty, a]} f_X(x) \\, dx \\right)\\\\ &amp; \\quad - \\left(\\int_{(b,\\infty)} f_X(x) \\, dx - \\int_{ (-\\infty, b]} f_X(x) \\, dx \\right) \\\\ &amp;= (\\mathbb{P}(X&gt;a) - \\mathbb{P}(X\\leq a)) - (\\mathbb{P}(X&gt;b) - \\mathbb{P}(X\\leq b)) \\\\ &amp;= \\mathbb{P}( a &lt; X &lt; b) + \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\mathbb{P}(X = a) + \\mathbb{P}(X = b) \\right), \\end{aligned} \\] as desired.

Each time one goes out to the field to sample, one gets different answers for the same set of quantities of interest, making those answers random variables. For finite population, there are two techniques called sampling with replacement and sampling without replacement. Sampling without replacement is sometimes called simple random sampling and one needs to be careful with it. However, if the population size is very very large compared to the sample size (a very subjective judgement), it is common in practice to treat the sampling data as I.I.D. RVs.

Those quantities could be a parameter in a parametric model, a CDF, PDF,… Typically, the quantity of interest is denoted by \\(\\theta\\), the point estimator is denoted by \\(\\hat \\theta\\) or \\(\\hat \\theta_n\\). So, combined with the above definition, \\[ \\hat \\theta_n = g(X_1, \\dots, X_n).\\] Note that, \\(\\hat \\theta_n\\) is still a random variable as this is a function of your sample data, which are RVs themselves.

However, modern statistics has a different point of view: because data is large, it doesn’t matter if the samples are biased as long as the estimators converge to the true quantity of interest. This gives rise to the following definition Definition 3.3 A point estimator \\(\\hat \\theta_n\\) of a parameter \\(\\theta\\) is consistent if \\(\\hat \\theta_n\\) converges to \\(\\theta\\) in probability.

Suppose we get \\(Y_1 = 9\\), \\(Y_2 = 11\\), \\(C = \\{ 10 \\}\\). Then, for sure, \\(\\theta = 10\\). Therefore, \\(\\mathbb{P}(\\theta \\in C | Y_1, Y_2) = 1\\).

Apply this to the Bernoulli parametric model \\[\\mathcal{F} = \\left\\{ \\mathbb{P}(X= 1) = p, \\mathbb{P}(X = 0) = 1-p; p \\in [0,1] \\right\\}.\\] Question: Suppose our sample comes from a Bernoulli distribution.

Find the confidence interval for the significance level \\(\\alpha\\). Compare this with the confidence interval in the previous exercise.

Which one would work the best? This is what we call decision theory. Often, within this theory, an estimator is called a decision rule and the possible values of the decision rule are called actions. The language here is also the language used in machine learning. You will find a few repeated ideas from previous sections. However, the ideas are natural. Before, one way to measure the discrepancy between the estimator \\(\\hat \\theta\\) and \\(\\theta\\) is the mean square error that we learned previously. However, that is not the only way. To generalize this idea, we define the loss function \\(L(\\theta, \\hat \\theta)\\) mapping from \\(\\Theta\\times \\Theta \\to \\mathbb{R}\\), where \\(\\Theta\\) is the set of parameters. Example 3.7 Here is a few examples of loss functions: \\(L(\\theta,\\hat \\theta) = (\\theta - \\hat \\theta)^2\\) Squared error loss \\(L(\\theta, \\hat \\theta) = |\\theta - \\hat\\theta|^p\\) \\(L^p\\) loss \\(L(\\theta,\\hat \\theta) = \\begin{cases}0, &amp; \\theta = \\hat \\theta \\\\ 1, &amp; \\theta\\not= \\hat\\theta\\end{cases}\\) zero-one loss \\(L(\\theta,\\hat \\theta) = I(|\\theta - \\hat\\theta|&gt;c)\\) where \\(I(x&gt;c) = \\begin{cases}0, &amp; |\\theta - \\hat \\theta| \\leq c \\\\ 1, &amp; |\\theta - \\hat \\theta| &gt; c\\end{cases}\\) large deviation loss \\(L(\\theta,\\hat \\theta) = \\int \\log\\left( \\frac{f(x;\\theta)}{f(x;\\hat \\theta)} \\right) f(x;\\theta)\\) Kullback-Leiber loss Definition 3.10 The risk of an estimator is \\[ R(\\theta, \\hat\\theta) = \\mathbb{E}_\\theta (L(\\theta,\\hat \\theta)). \\] The risk from the squared error loss is the mean squared error.

A hypothesis is composite if it is not simple. So, we could have cases where one of the hypotheses is simple and the other is composite, both are simple, or both are composite. Due to probabilistic nature of the procedure, there are a few scenarios \\(H_0\\) is true \\(H_1\\) is true Reject \\(H_0\\) Type I error (false positive) Correct decision Reject \\(H_1\\) Correct decision Type II error (false negative) One of the working assumption of science is that all models are wrong and only approximations of reality. So, the goal of science is to try to reject the hypothesis \\(H_0\\). The harder it is to reject \\(H_0\\), the better of a theory as an approximation of reality. However, there is a conundrum the two types of errors will happen and it is not possible to minimize both at the same time. Example 4.1 Let \\(C = \\emptyset\\). Then the probability for Type I error is \\(0\\) as one will never reject \\(H_0\\). However, if it turns out that \\(H_1\\) is true, then the probability for Type II error would be \\(1\\). Often, we consider a false positive to be worse than a false negative (imagine a medical test says that you don’t have a sickness while you do). So, we want to do the following: Choose small probability \\(\\alpha\\) and find reasonable critical regions that make the probability for Type I error be bounded by \\(\\alpha\\). Among these critical regions, minimize the probability for Type II error. Note that we have \\[ 1 - \\mathbb{P}_\\theta ( \\text{Type II error}) = \\mathbb{P}_\\theta \\left[ (X_1, \\dots, X_n) \\in C \\right].\\] This inspires the following definitions Definition 4.1 (size (significance level) of critical region) We say that a critical region \\(C\\) is of size (or significance level) \\(\\alpha\\) if \\[ \\alpha = \\max_{\\theta \\in D_0} \\mathbb{P}_\\theta \\left[ (X_1, \\dots, X_n) \\in C \\right].\\] Definition 4.2 (Power function of critical region) A power function of a critical region \\(C\\) is a function \\(\\gamma_C: D_1 \\to [0,1]\\) so that \\[ \\gamma_C(\\theta) = \\mathbb{P}_\\theta \\left[ (X_1, \\dots, X_n) \\in C \\right].\\] Remark. From the above discussion, the quality of a hypothesis test is really determined by choosing the right critical region \\(C\\). So a test is better than another test when the critical region of it is better than the critical region of the other one. We, thus, need to be able to compare critical regions. Definition 4.3 Given two critical regions \\(C_1\\) and \\(C_2\\) of size \\(\\alpha\\), \\(C_1\\) is better than \\(C_2\\) (denoted by \\(C_1 \\succeq C_2\\)) if \\[\\gamma_{C_1}(\\theta) \\geq \\gamma_{C_2}(\\theta)\\,, \\forall \\theta \\in D_1.\\] Note that, not any pair of critical regions are comparable. "],["neyman-pearson-lemma.html", "4.2 Neyman-Pearson Lemma", " 4.2 Neyman-Pearson Lemma Assumption throughout this section: both hypotheses are simple. When both the null and alternative hypotheses are simple, we can talk about the most powerful tests (or the best critical region). Denote \\(X = (X_1, \\dots, X_n)\\) and recall that the space that this lives in is a state space \\(S\\). Definition 4.4 Let \\(C\\) be a subset of the state space. Then we say that \\(C\\) is the best critical region of size \\(\\alpha\\) for testing the simple hypothesis \\(H_0: \\theta = \\theta_0\\) against the alternative simple hypothesis \\(H_1: \\theta = \\theta_1\\) if \\(P_{\\theta_0}( (X_1, \\dots, X_n) \\in C ) = \\alpha\\) And for every subset \\(A\\) of the state space \\[ \\mathbb{P}_{\\theta_0}( X \\in A) = \\alpha \\implies \\mathbb{P}_{\\theta_1}(X \\in C) \\geq \\mathbb{P}_{\\theta_1} ( X \\in A)\\] Exercise 4.1 (Hogg et. al., 4.5.3) Let \\(X\\) be an RV that has pdf \\(f(x;\\theta) = \\theta x^{\\theta - 1}\\) for \\(0&lt;x&lt;1\\), zero elsewhere. Here, \\(\\theta \\in \\{ 1,2\\}\\). To test the simple hypothesis \\(H_0: \\theta = 1\\) against the alternative simple hypothesis \\(H_1: \\theta = 2\\), use a random sample \\(X_1, X_2\\) of size \\(n = 2\\) and define the critical region to be \\(C = \\{ x: x_1 x_2 \\geq 3/4 \\}\\). Find the power function of the test. Exercise 4.2 (Hogg et. al., 4.5.5) Let \\(X_1, X_2\\) be a random sample of size \\(n=2\\) from the distribution having pdf \\(f(x ; \\theta)=(1 / \\theta) e^{-x / \\theta}, 0&lt;x&lt;\\infty\\), zero elsewhere.

We reject \\(H_0: \\theta=2\\) and accept \\(H_1: \\theta=1\\) if the observed values of \\(X_1, X_2\\), say \\(x_1, x_2\\), are such that \\[ \\frac{f\\left(x_1 ; 2\\right) f\\left(x_2 ; 2\\right)}{f\\left(x_1 ; 1\\right) f\\left(x_2 ; 1\\right)} \\leq \\frac{1}{2} . \\] Find the significance level of the test and the power of the test when \\(H_0\\) is false. Exercise 4.3 (Hogg et. al., 4.5.9) Let \\(X\\) have a Poisson distribution with mean \\(\\theta\\). Consider the simple hypothesis \\(H_0: \\theta=\\frac{1}{2}\\) and the alternative composite hypothesis \\(H_1: \\theta&lt;\\frac{1}{2}\\). Thus \\(\\Omega=\\left\\{\\theta: 0&lt;\\theta \\leq \\frac{1}{2}\\right\\}\\). Let \\(X_1, \\ldots, X_{12}\\) denote a random sample of size 12 from this distribution. We reject \\(H_0\\) if and only if the observed value of \\(Y=X_1+\\cdots+X_{12} \\leq 2\\). Show that the following \\(\\mathrm{R}\\) code graphs the power function of this test: theta =seq(.1, .5, .05)$; gam=ppois(2, theta * 12) plot (gam theta,pch=&quot; &quot;,xlab=expression(theta),ylab=expression(gamma)) lines (gam ~ theta) Run the code. Determine the significance level from the plot. Example 4.2 Consider the following table Let’s consider the hypothesis test of \\(H_0: \\theta = 1/2\\) versus \\(H_1: \\theta = 3/4\\) with the following probability table: \\(x\\) 0 1 2 3 4 5 \\(f(x ; 1 / 2)\\) \\(1 / 32\\) \\(5 / 32\\) \\(10 / 32\\) \\(10/32\\) \\(5/32\\) \\(1/32\\) \\(f(x ; 3 / 4)\\) \\(1 / 1024\\) \\(15 / 1024\\) \\(90 / 1024\\) \\(270/1024\\) \\(405/1024\\) \\(243/1024\\) \\(f(x ; 1 / 2) / f(x ; 3 / 4)\\) \\(32 / 1\\) \\(32 / 3\\) \\(32 / 9\\) \\(32/27\\) \\(32/81\\) \\(32/243\\) Find the critical regions of sizes \\(1/32\\) and \\(6/32\\). Find the best critical region of size \\(1/32\\) ad \\(6/32\\). Observe what happens to the ratio \\(f(x;½)/ f(x; ¾)\\). Recall the likelihood function \\[\\mathcal{L}(\\theta;x) = \\prod_{i=1}^n f(x_i;\\theta)\\] where \\(x = (x_1, \\dots, x_n)\\). Theorem 4.1 (Neyman-Pearson Theorem) Let \\(X_1, \\dots, X_n\\) be a sample from a family of distributions \\(f(x;\\theta)\\), where \\(\\theta \\in \\{\\theta_0, \\theta_1\\}\\). Let \\(k\\) be a positive number and \\(C\\) be a subset of the state space such that \\(\\displaystyle{\\frac{\\mathcal{L}(\\theta_0;x)}{\\mathcal{L}(\\theta_1;x)}} \\leq k\\) for each point \\(x\\in C\\). \\(\\displaystyle\\frac{\\mathcal{L}(\\theta_0;x)}{\\mathcal{L}(\\theta_1;x)} \\geq k\\) for each point \\(x\\in C^c\\). \\(\\alpha = P_{\\theta_0}(X \\in C)\\). Then \\(C\\) is a bests critical region of size \\(\\alpha\\) for testing the hypothesis \\(H_0: \\theta= \\theta_0\\) against the alternative hypothesis \\(H_1: \\theta = \\theta_1\\). From Example 4.2, we see that the best critical region has the the property that its power is higher than its significance level. This is interpreted as: the probability of falsely rejecting \\(H_0\\) is less than the probability of correctly rejecting \\(H_0\\). We say that the kind of test (i.e., critical region) that has this property is unbiased. Formally, Definition 4.5 Let \\(X \\sim f(x;\\theta)\\). A test is said to be unbiased if \\[\\inf_{\\theta \\in D_1} \\mathbb{P}_{\\theta} (X \\in C) \\geq \\alpha.\\] Proposition 4.1 Let \\(C\\) be the critical region of the best test of \\(H_0: \\theta = \\theta_0\\) versus \\(H_1: \\theta = \\theta_1\\). Suppose the significance level of the test is \\(\\alpha\\), then the power of the test is at least \\(\\alpha\\), .i.e, \\[\\gamma_C (\\theta_1) \\geq \\alpha.\\] Exercise 4.4 (Hogg et. al., 8.1.5) If \\(X_1, X_2, \\ldots, X_n\\) is a random sample from a distribution having pdf of the form \\(f(x ; \\theta)=\\theta x^{\\theta-1}, 0&lt;x&lt;1\\), zero elsewhere, show that a best critical region for testing \\(H_0: \\theta=1\\) against \\(H_1: \\theta=2\\) is \\(C=\\left\\{\\left(x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_n\\right): c \\leq \\prod_{i=1}^n x_i\\right\\}\\). "],["uniformly-most-powerful-test.html", "4.3 Uniformly Most Powerful Test", " 4.3 Uniformly Most Powerful Test In a simple testing case, the Neyman-Pearson theorem provides a theoretical justification for choosing a critical region to create the best hypothesis test, given the significance level. However, when the hypotheses are no longer simple, the situation becomes more complicated. To extend the result of Neyman-Pearson to non-simple cases, we need the following notion. Definition 4.6 (Uniformly Most Powerful Test) The critical region \\(C\\) is a Uniformly Most Powerful (UMP) critical region of size \\(\\alpha\\) for testing the simple hypothesis \\(H_0\\) against an alternative composite hypothesis \\(H_1\\) if the set \\(C\\) is a best critical region of size \\(\\alpha\\) for testing \\(H_0\\) against each simple hypothesis in \\(H_1\\). A test defined by this critical region \\(C\\) is called a uniformly most powerful test, with significance level \\(\\alpha\\), for testing the simple hypothesis \\(H_0\\) against the alternative composite hypothesis \\(H_1\\). Example 4.3 Let \\(X_1, \\dots, X_n\\) be sample from \\(N(\\mu, 1)\\). Let \\(H_0: \\mu = 1\\) and \\(H_1: \\mu &gt;1\\) be our hypotheses. Suppose we want the significance level to be \\(\\alpha = 0.9\\), use whatever software you can to find the uniformly most powerful critical region for this significance level and \\(n = 10\\). Example 4.4 Let \\(X_1, \\dots, X_n\\) be sample from \\(N(0, \\theta)\\). Let \\(H_0: \\theta = 3\\) and \\(H_1: \\theta &gt;3\\) be our hypotheses. Suppose we want the significance level to be \\(\\alpha = 0.9\\), use whatever software you can to find the uniformly most powerful critical region for this significance level and \\(n = 10\\). Example 4.5 There is no uniformly most powerful critical region for the two-tail test of the Gaussian.
